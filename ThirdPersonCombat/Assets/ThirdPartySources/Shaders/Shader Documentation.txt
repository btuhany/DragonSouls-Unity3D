Hi :)

The textures come with a complementary shader called "TextureMe/Tessellation"
Of course, you can use your own shader if you wish.
The "TextureMe/Tessellation" shader helps the materials to properly showcase the textures.
The shader has the following properties:

- Height:  Controls how much the surface is extruded outwards.

- TesselationSize:  The "tightness" of polygonal subdivisions, relative to distance to camera. Smaller = more detailed, but less performant.

- Ambient Occlusion Strength:  adds extra "darkness" in some of the creases and cracks, if the Ambient Occlusion texture is assigned.

- Offset, Tiling:  allows you to scale and shift all the textures.

- Base (RGB):  Texture containing colors (Albedo colors or Diffuse colors)

- Height Texture:  Texture that dictates where to extrude the surface.

- Normalmap:  Texture describing the surface details that react to lighting changes.

- Ambient Occlusion:  Texture that describes where the extra shadows should appear, typically around the cracks and creases.

- Specularity:  Texture that describes changes in shininess across the surface.

- Smoothness:  A coefficient allowing to make the surface appear more matte or smooth.

- Emissive: Texture describing where the glow should occur, and with which color.

- Emissive Strength: A coefficient allowing to dim down the effect of the Emissive property.

- Color: Allows to add a surface a tint.
